## Ableton About Page

This is a recreation of [Ableton's about page](https://www.ableton.com/en/about/), built with React (for componentization) and TailwindCSS.

This is mainly an exercise for rebuilding the different grids (collages and footer) on the page, though using native CSS Grid instead of absolute/relative positioning.

**Discaimer**: This project is purely self-educational in purpose. I have no affiliation with Ableton or their products whatsoever.
