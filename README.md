## Ableton About Page

This is a recreation of [Ableton's about page](https://www.ableton.com/en/about/), built with React (for componentization) and TailwindCSS.

This is mainly a practice for rebuilding the grids (collages and footer) on the page, though using native CSS Grid instead of absolute/relative positioning.

**Discaimer**: This project is purely self-educational in purpose. I have no affiliation with Ableton or their products whatsoever.
